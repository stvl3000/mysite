# mysite
This is the project created according the Django official standard tutorial, Writing your first Django app. It has been loaded to the web online for demonstration purpose.

I built a free Red Hat Enterprise Linux server to provide web serves. Your are more than welcome to visit it at a new URL:

http://ec2-52-207-252-146.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

The home page temporarily borrowed the html from Django official web site. More functions may be added in the future. 
 
Following the finger, â˜ž, pointed link, you will get to the page of the polls app.  

Should you have any interest, suggestion, or simply want to use any function, you are more than welcome to keep watching it or informing me.


Thank you.
